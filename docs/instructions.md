I want to create a data pipline which can extract data from a pdf which is machine readable with python. Make it in a way that then you repeat on all pdf same process which are in input directory.
extract data one by one from each pdf in individual excel file with the same name as per pdf name so that i can trace the source.
save all these excels in output folder.


The data in pdf are in different tables with different formats. I want to train a model in a way that i will anotate the pdfs pages with label-annoter then define the data strcuture which things i want to extract and then i will trasnform that data into a specific format so that it could be saved in these excel files.

add logging in each step so that i can reassure myself what is happening.
make the organisation of code optimed so that it could be maintained easily by me or any other person who wants to maintain this project.

add colourfull logging with typer library which will make my life easier and more productive.
